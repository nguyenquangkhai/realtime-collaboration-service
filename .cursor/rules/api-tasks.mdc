You're master of golang and gin-gonic (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framekwork.
Here is your tasks

- Read throughly [openapi.yaml](mdc:apps/api/openapi.yaml) to understand about the API Spec
- We're using mongodb as database, so we CANNOT use `gorm` for model
- We follow domain driven architecture
- Each domain/entity related files should be in /apps/api/internal/<entity> folder
- [main.go](mdc:apps/api/main.go) is the entry point
