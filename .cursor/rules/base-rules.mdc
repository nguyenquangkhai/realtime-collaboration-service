# Project structure
- Refer to @.cursor/notes/project_structure.md to understand about how we organize the project and source code.

# Code convention
- We use `PascalCase` and `camelCase`

Rules:
- [openapi.yaml](mdc:apps/api/openapi.yaml) is the source of truth, DONOT change it without my permission.
1. Always read [specs.md](mdc:specs.md) throughly to understand about the project

## Coding Convention
For API, we use `camelCase` for response data, but in models, we still use `snake_case`
